Think that no stubborn, sullen arithm-ite,

Which fix'd to a pillar, or a grave, doth sit

Bedded and bathed in all his ordures, dwells

So foully as our souls in their first-built cells.
“Anatomy‚ Second Ann.,” ll. 169-72.

See, for a repetition, Donne’s Elegy, No. IX.
Lines just before and after those in Donne are also
remembered by Webster :—

Think but how poor thou wast, how obnoxious ε
Whom a small lump of flesh could poison thus.
This curded milk, this poor unletter’d whelp,
My body, &c.—-Ll. 163-6.

Bosola. Thou art a box of worm-seed, at best but a salvatory of

green mummy. What’s this flesh? a little crudded milk, fantastical
puff-paste.

“Duchess of Ma1fi‚” IV. ii. 143-·5, p. 87, col. 2.
The quartos of 1640 and 1678 read “curded'’ for
“crudded,'' thus agreeing with Donne.

Think that a rusty piece, discharged‚ is flown
In pieces, δια-Μ. 181-2.

Duch. O misery! like to a rusty o’er-charg’d cannen,
shall Ι never fly in pieces?
“Duchess of Ma1fi‚” 111. v. 124-5‚ p. 83, col. 1.
The fantastical notion of comparing the Duchess's
grief-stricken face to an oft-dyed garment was also
suggested by Donne :—

Card. I do not think but sorrow makes her look
Like to an oft-dy'd garment.
“Duchess of Malfi‚” V. ii. 120-1, p. 94, col. 1.
