hangman’s rope, and dying with the laughter caused
by the sensation, is made use of by Webster. The
Duke of Florence causes Brachiano to be strangled3
and, Flamineo, commenting on the crime and its

author, says :—

He doth not come, like a gross plodding slave,

And buffet you to death3 no, my quaint knave,

He tickles you to death, makes you die laughing.
“The White Devil,’' ll. 2950-2, p. 43, col. 1.

We may assume for the moment that Brachiano died
laughing.

Montaigne does not approve of the conduct of those
who in the pursuit of pleasure are rash and headlong
in enjoying it :—

The more steps and degrees there are, the more delight and honour
is there on the top.

And in the same column he says :—-

1 wot not who in ancient time wished his throat were as long as
a cranes neck that so hee might the longer and more leasurely taste
what he swallowed.—Book 111. chap. v. p. 448, col. 2.

Thus in Marston :—-

Franceschina. You shall not gulp down all delights at once.

No, no·‚ I’ll make-you chew §our pleasure vit love3
De more degrees and steps, de more delight,
De more endeared is de pleasure height.

Go, little vag, plezisure should· have· a cra.ne's
Long neck, to relish de ambrosia of delight.
“The Dutch courtezan‚“ V. i. 28-37.
