Our senses, too, are oftentimes dulled and altered
by the passions of the mind or by diseases of the
body :—

Such as are troubled with the yellow jandise deeme all things they

looke upon to be yellowish, which seeme more pale and wan to them
then to us.-—Book II. chap. xii. p. 307, col. 1.

Flumineo. . . . they that have the yellow jaundice think all
objects they look on to be yellow. Jealousy is worser: her fits pre-
sent to a man, like so many bubbles in a bason of water, twenty
several crabbed faces, &c.—“The White Devi1,” ll. 213-17‚ p. 8, col. 1.

Again :—

Forsomuch as our sight, being altered, represents unto itselfe things
alike3 and we imagine that things faile it as it doth to thern: As
they who travell by sea, to whom mountains, fields, townes, heaven

and earth, seeme to goe the same motion, and keepe the same course
they doe.—Book ΙΙ. chap. xiii. pp. 310-11.

Webster makes use of this instance of illusion in
the following speech, addressed to Camillo :—

Flumineo. So perfect shall be thy happiness, that, as men at sea
think land and trees and ships go that way they go, so both heaven
and earth shall seem to go your voyage.-—“The White Devil‚”

ll. 267-71, pp. 8-9.
Ben Jonson has these lines :—

Peaee, Luxury, thou art like one of those

who, being at sea, suppose

Because they move, the continent doth so.
“The Forest,” xi. Epode.

A parallel, but varied, is to be found in Albumuzw,
ΙΙΙ. iv. :—
