lead one to imagine that Jonson was directed through-
out by Bacon.

Horace appears followed by Crispinus, a vain bab-
bler, who pursues him up and down like his ill angel,
and threatens many times to recite to the poet some
of his own doggerel effusions. Fortunately, Cris-
pinus’ memory is so bad that he ufails to remember
the children of his fancy. Yet Horace cannot get
rid of his tormentor, who sticks to him like a burr,
and plies him with ridiculous twaddle. In his despair
Horace compares his case with that of Bolanus :—

Whose freedom, and impatience of this fellow,

Would long ere this have call'd him fool, and fool,
And rank and tedious fool Ι and have flung jests

As hard as stones‚ till thou hadst pelted him

Out of the place. Act. 111. sc. 1.

Here we may say that the threat to recite verses, and
the despairing allusion of Horace to Bolanus, are the
result of these two Promus entries :—

1027. Nec sua vesanus scripta poeta legat.

1051. O te, Bolane, cerebri
Felicem ! aiebam tacitus.
Horace, Sat. Ι. ἰκ. 11-12.

for neglecting the study of the law for poetry; and
in the scene at the end of the play Jonson explains
