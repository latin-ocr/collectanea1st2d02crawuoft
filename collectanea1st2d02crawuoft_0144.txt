ful phrases that were invented by Bacon. Be careful
ofthe falling bricks—and the dust. Let me quote:—

Shakespeare's phrase “out ofjoint‚'' which has passed into current
speech, so that its singular and original character is forgotten, is used
more than once both in Shakespeare and Bacon.

The variant, “out of frame,’' is also proved to be
singular and original in character by a quotation from
Hamlet. Now, although Dr. Theobald was able to
quote cases of the former phrase from Bacon, he for-
got to adduce cases of the use of “out of frame’'
from his work. These omissions are very interesting.
Elsewhere he gives us a list of words that were coined
by Bacon in Shakespeare3 but, again, in most cases
he forgets to show us where Bacon uses them in his
acknowledged work. Will Dr. Theobald just trouble
to get a list of the hundreds of very rare words that
are to be found in the real Bacon, and advise us that
the same are not to be found in Shakespeare ? Omis-
sions tell much3 but commonplaces, such as those of
the Baconians, prove nothing, except the presence of
a plague of Egyptian darkness.
“Singular and original in character‚” forsooth!

To thy correction now haaste and hie,
For thou haast been out quoynt al to longe.
