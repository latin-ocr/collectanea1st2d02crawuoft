And so in Webster, but in a varying sense, we find
the same figure and phrasing used :—

First Pilgrim. If that a man be thrust into a well,
No matter who sets hand to ’t‚ his own weight
Will bring him sooner to the bottom.
“The Duchess of Malfi,” 111. iv. 45-7, p. 82, col. 1.

All lovers of Webster must admire the remarkably
fine speech ofAntonio near the end of the play, where
he indulges in reflections conjured up by the sight of
the ruins of an old abbey :—

Antonio. Ι do love these ancient ruins.
We never tread upon them but we set
Our foot upon some reverend history, &c.
“The Duchess of Malfi‚'’ V. iii. 10-12‚ p. 97, col. 2.

It is with a keen sense of regret that I must point
out that the ideas and expressions in this speech are
borrowed3 yet Webster‚ here as elsewhere, has not
done injustice to his original, for he has given them a
noble setting and made them his own by his beautiful
adaptation of them. But, after all, Montaigne him-
self is borrowing; and in many places of his book he
commends such borrowing as Webster’s.

Montaigne is referring to Rome particularly. I
have space for only a short quotation :—

And therefore can I not so often looke into the situation of their
streets and houses, and those wondrous—strange ruines, that may be
said to reach down to the Anfipodes, but so often must 1 ammuse my
selfe on them. . . . Tanta vis admonitionis inest in locis .· et id quidem
