removed in their motions by the same springs and wards that we are

Montaigne refers to the counsel of Epicurus to

are once falne into the pits it is no matter who thrusts you in, you

never cease till you come to the bottome. The fall presseth‚ hasteneth‚
mooveth‚ and furthereth it selse.—Book 11. chap. xxxi. p. 366, col. z.
