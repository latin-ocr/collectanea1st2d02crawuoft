The experiment, apparently, was successful 3 but this
is how Bosola represents the result :—

There was a lady in France that, having had the small-pox‚ flayed
the skin off her face to make it more leve13 and whereas before she

looked like a nutmeg-grater, after she resembled an abortive hedge-

But Bosola is nothing if he is not philosophica13

reasonings, but thinks that the scholar's melancholy,
