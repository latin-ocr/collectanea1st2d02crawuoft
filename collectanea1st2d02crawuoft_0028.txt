man. His “implication and entangling of speech‚'’
which beguiles men, “may fitly be compared unto

juglers’ play of fast and loose.'' (Book ΙΙΙ. chap. viii.

p. 473, col. 1.) Compare the whole ofthe Conjurer's
speech with Montaigne‚ especially the following :——-

They'd make men think the devil were fast and loose,
With speaking fustian Latin.
“The White Devil‚'’ ll. 1007-8, p. 17, col. 2.

Montaigne explains what “fast and loose” means,
and he is responsible for the reference to the jugglers'
Latin in Webster. In his admirable edition of The
W hite Devil and of The Duchess of Malfi‚ recently
published, Prof. Martin Sampson quotes Mr. W. J.
Craig’s note in Reginald Scot. Fast and loose “is a
trick game with a handkerchief or belt, the point
being that a knot or loop which seems tied fast is
really loose.” This is exactly the meaning of the
phrase in Montaigne.

I will turn to Marston once more. Dulcimel
wishes to impart a secret to Philocalia, but the latter
is chary of being its guardian :-—

Philo. You may trust my silence3 Ι can command that 3 but if 1
chance to be questioned 1 must speak truth ε Ι can conceal, but not

deny my knowledge. That must command me.
Dul. Fie on these philosophical discoursing women l—“The Fawn‚”

ΙΙΙ. i. 183—7.

In other words, fie on Montaigne !—
