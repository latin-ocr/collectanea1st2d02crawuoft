Ι3

It is a paine for me to dissemble, so that I refuse to take charge
of other men's secretS, as wanting hart to disavow my knowledge. I
can conceale it3 but deny it 1 cannot, without much ado and some
trouble. To be perfectly secrete, one must be so by nature, not by
obligation.—“ Book 111. chap. v. p. 430, col. 1.

Hercules. Dear sleep and lust, I thank y0u3 but for you,
Mortal till now I scarce had known myself.
“The Fawn‚” 1. ii. 331-2.

Of course, this has reference to the well-known say-

ing of Alexander the Great :—

Alexander said that he knew himselfe mortall chiefly by this action
and by sleeping.——Book ΙΙΙ. chap. v. p. 447, col. 1.

The saying forms No. 123 of Bacon's Apophthegms‚
and it is quoted in The Advancement of Learning‚
Book I.‚ and in the corresponding part of the De
Augmentis. It is very surprising to find what a num-
ber of Bacon’s Apophthegms are paralleled in Mon-
taigne. The moral is that there was no need for
Shakespeare or others to go to Bacon for certain
matter, which has been paraded with a great blowing
of trumpets.

In his Essay of Trutlz Bacon says :—-

There is no Vice‚ that doth so cover a Man with Shame, as to be
found false and perfidious. And therefore Mountaigny saith prettily,
when he enquired the reason, why the word of the Lie, should be
such a Disgrace, and such an Odious Charge? saith he, “If it be
well weighed, To say that a man lieth, is as much to say, as that he
is brave towards God, and a Coward towards men.” For a Lie faces
God, and shrinkes from Man.
