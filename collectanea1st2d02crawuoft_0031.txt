It were not fit
1 should bestow so main a piccc of wrong
Upon my friend 3 ‘tis a grattfication
Only due to a strumpet.
“The Duchess of Malfi,” V. i. 56-9, p. 92, col. 1.

Compare :—

Epaminondas had caused a dissolute young man to be imprisoned3
Pelopidas intreated him, that for his sake he would set him at libertie,
but he refused him, and yeelded to free him at the request of an harlot
of his, which likewise sued for his enlargement; saying, it was a

gratg'fi‘cation due unto a Coscrtizan, and not to a Captaine.—Book Ι.
chap. xxix. p. 91, col. 1.

Bosola is a master of phrases, and he is fond of
sayings of men eminent for their wisdom, which he
does not scruple to use as occasion offers. I will deal
with some of his utterances and trace them to their
various sources ;--

Bosola. Ι have done you better service than to be slighted thus.
Miserable age, where only the reward of doing well is the doing of
it.—“The Duchess of Malfi,'' Ι. i. 32-4, p. 59, cols. 1 and 2.

The speech is addressed to the Cardinal, and it per-
verts a lofty sentiment expressed by Seneca 1——

Recte fizcti, jecisse merces est: Officii fructi, ipsum officium est: The
reward of well-doing is the doing, and the fruit of our duty is our
duty.——Montaigne, Book 11. chap. xvi. p. 323, col. 1.

The Cardinal, replying to Bosola, exclaims,

Would you could become honest !
Bosola. With all your divinity do but direct me the way to it. I
have known many travel far for it, and yet return as arrant knaves
