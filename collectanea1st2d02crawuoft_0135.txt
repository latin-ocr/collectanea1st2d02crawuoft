on his memory of what it contained, and which con-
sists in part of a small collection of Latin sentences
from the Mimi of Publius Syrus, includes several
sentences which Ben Jonson translates or alludes to
in his various writings. I will quote a few cases, but
would remark in reference to them that, although
they tend to make him come nearer to Bacon in
learning than Shakespeare, it is not to be supposed
that the same sayings were unknown to other writers
of the time, or that they are even rare. I can find
them nearly all in John Lyly, and some of them are
the originals of very old English proverbs.

Haeredis fletus sub persona risus est.
Male secum agit aeger, medicum qui haeredem facit.

Both sayings are referred to in the same scene
(Act I. sc. i.) of The Fox :—

Mosca. Tut ! forget‚ sir.

The weeping of an heir should still be laughter
Under a visor.

Mosca. 1 often have
Heard him protest, that your physician
Should never be his heir.

Multis minatur, qui uni facit injuriam.
Silius. He threatens many that hath injured one.
“Sejanus‚’' Act. 11. sc. iv.

And the following, to which I have already made
allusion :—

Arcum, intensio frangit3 animum, remissio.
