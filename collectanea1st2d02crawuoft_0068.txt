echo The Duchess of M alfii :—

all our sear,
Nay, all our terror, is, lest our physician,

should put us in the ground to be made sweet.

11., i., 70-2‚ p. 67, col. 1.
and, I imagine, they are not original, because Ran-
dolph has an almost identical line in his poem on the
death of Lady Venetia Digby, who died in 1633.
I suspect that here there is a case of borrowing from
the same source :—

Bring all the spices that Arabia yields‚

Distil the choicest flowers that paint the fields3
And when in one their best perfectioris meet,
Embalm her corse, that she may make them sweet.

Ll. 23-30 are copied almost without alteration from
Ben Jonson’s dedication to the same Prince Henry
of his Musque oneen53 and one of these borrowed
lines appears again in the same form in The Duchess

ofMalfi, III. ii. 299, in connexion with a passage
from the Arcadia, which is again only slightly altered
in the elegy, ll. 78-9‚ and paralleled once more in
Appius and Virginia, I. ii. 12-4. The Arcadia and
Ben Jonson parallels are more fully dealt with in my
Sidney-Webster paper (Collectanea Ser. 1).

Lines 39-40,

He spread his bounty with a provident hand,
And not like those that sow th’ ingrateful saud,
