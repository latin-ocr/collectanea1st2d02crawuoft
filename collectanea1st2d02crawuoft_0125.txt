And not to counsel rashly, or on the sudden, but with advice and
meditation (Dat nox consilium).—“Discoveries ε Obsequentia‚'’ &c-

A favourite saying of Bacon's was that books or
the dead are the best counsellors. He quotes the
Latin of this saying in the Essay ofCounsel, and Jon-
son imitates him very closely :—

It was truly said, Optimi consiliarii mortui.- books will speak plain
when counsellors blanch.

Compare :—

And how can he be counselled that cannot see to read the best
counsellors (which are books); for they neither flatter us nor hide
from us ?—-“Discoveries: Illiteratus,” &c.

Again, in the same essay‚ Bacon says that

the true composition of a counsellor is, rather to be skilful in their
master's business than in his nature 3 for then he is like to advise him,
and not to feed his humour.

The passage is related to Pramus entry No. 104 :—

Cunning in the humours of persons, but not in the conditione of
actions.

Bacon uses the note many times, and Jonson imitates
him in the following as well as elsewhere :—

In being able to counsel others, a man must be furnished with an
universal stote in himself . . . But especially you must be cunning
in the nature of man, &c.—⁴‘Discoveries: Cognit. univers.'’

Bacon's Novum Organum, his Advancement of
Learning, and other works are all imitated in the
Discoveries‚ which are full of so-called Pramus notes,
