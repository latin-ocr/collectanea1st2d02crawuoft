author of the work that goes under his name, and
not one of his contemporaries can be tortured into
saying that Bacon ever wrote playS‚ 01· that he was
ever capable of writing even decent poetry. He
tried his prentice hand on a translation of the psalm,
but it is a miserable performance, and reminds one
of the saying of Ben Jonson, that “Virgil's felicity
left him in prose, as Tully’s forsook him in verse.''
He is a Virgil in prose, but a Tully in verse. Now,
seeing that the claim for Bacon is founded entirely
on parallels to be found in his writings and those of
Shakespeare‚ it is the business of his followers to prove
that their parallels have a distinctive value. Know-
ing the precarious position they are in, they usher in
the evidence with a great blowing of trumpets; they
say the phrasing in Bacon and the plays is unique,
and that others never use the same or similar images
and learning in the same way. But, as a matter of
fact, these parallels are mostly dreary commonplaces‚
and the braying of the trumpets is only the prelude
to the fall of the walls of Jericho. If the foundations
are not safe, if
The pillars‚ that have bolstered up those terms,

rock to and fro at a touch, what becomes of the
building—the so-called cumulative argument?
