Jacobean literature is worthy of acceptance. It may The
be that Ι did wrong in turning aside from Mrs. Pott Bacen-
to Dr. Theobald‚ and that ifI had continued to my Shakespeare
first purpose I should have made a more solid contri- ⁴Qtesz‘ion.
bution towards the settlement of this question of
Bacon versus Shakespeare. However that may be, I
claim that Ι have proved,
lst. That, Baconians are not sufficiently acquainted

with the acknowledged writing of their master or

of contemporary authors to be fit judges in cases

of this kind.
2nd. That Bacon did use his Promus notes in his

known works, and that they are not employed in

the same way in Shakespeare.
3rd. That the notes are commonplaces, to be found

in all Elizabethan and Jacobean writers.
4th. That Ben Jonson approaches more nearly to

Bacon in his use of the notes than Shakespeare

does.
5th. That Shakespeare was not a good scholar as

Bacon and Jonson were, and that he could and

did obtain much of his knowledge of classical

authors from translations or from the writings of

men who wrote in his mother tongue.
