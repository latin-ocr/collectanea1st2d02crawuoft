out fire finds expression several times in Shakespeare‚
and it is a maxim in the Baconian philosophy. Ergo,
Bacon wrote Shakespeare.

It is true that Bacon does not anywhere in all his
work couple the nail proverb with its perhaps more
ancient broffier-saying, but that does not matter. It
is coupled so in Shakespeare, and that fact squares the
circle, and proves the origin of the passages in the
plays.

Here we may observe that the lines in The Two
Gentlemen of Verona are imitated from Romeus and
saliet, the foundation-stone of Shakespeare's Romeo
and saliet, a poem written by one Arthur Brooke in
or about 1562, when Bacon and Shakespeare were
just out of their swaddling-clothes.

Chapman, in his Monsieur D’Olive‚ V. i. 5-13‚
illustrates Bacon's original notion admirably3 and
John Lyly expoundsxit in orthodox fashion twice in
Euphues. Many other writers of the time do like-
wise3 but if anybody wishes to find other parallels to
the passage outside Shakespeare‚ he will be wise if he
avoids Bacon, who has nothing like it in all his work,
except such sayings as that which we find in Henry
VII., where he writes that the citizens, finding the

the gates to be set on fire by the enemy, “repulsed
fire with fire.’'
