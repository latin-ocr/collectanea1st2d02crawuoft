other is not disputed3 but it is not known, even by
those who are most versed in Bacon’s work, that
certain entries in the Promus have a direct relation
to Ben Jonson's masques and plays. I will deal
with these entries in the proper place. All I urge
now is that if parallels can be used to filch from a
man the work that was universally assigned to him
by contemporaries—if we must ignore all tradition,
and the voice of a cloud of witnesses-——if gross and
palpable differences in the style of writers are to count
for nothing—then Shakespeare must be thrown over-
board by the Baconians, and they must elect Ben
Jonson in his place, because Jonson repeats Bacon
much more nearly than Shakespeare does, and be—
cause, on their own showing, the writer of the Jon-
son plays is a different man from the writer of the
Shakespeare plays and poems. Shakespeare does not
and cannot be made to illustrate many of the Pramus
entries in the way that Bacon and Jonson illustrate
them; and the ludicrous manner in which Ildrs. Pott
essayed the task only serves to show that it is an easy
matter to prove by such parallels that Bacon must
have written everything that had been penned up to
his time, including the Bible, and not forgetting that
portion of it which is entitled the Book of Judges.
For it is a nuth, and one that we should ponder over
