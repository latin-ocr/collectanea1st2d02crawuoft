but it is quite clear from this list that the followers
have been too busy groping blindly into other men’s
works to be able to find time to devote to the master
himself. Hundreds of notes, some of which Bacon
uses many times over, are not mentioned in Dr.
Theobald's list. It is very strange that so many
willing workers, in all parts of the world, who pro-
fess to know Bacon’s work so well, should be ignor-
ant of matters which so vitally concern Baeon’s own
work; for I need hardly observe that a thorough
knowledge of the manner in which a man uses his
notes is absolutely necessary in cases where it is de-
sired to reclaim other work, supposed to be his. The
omission to work the Pramus properly with Bacon
is so strange to me that I often ask myself whether
the Baconians have essayed the task and stopped short
because they perceived that such conscientious work
would be fatal to their theories.

One note very frequently used by Bacon, and
which Baconians could not help recording, although
they fail to remark on the marvellous number of
times it figures in the master’s work, is the follow-
