State shapes are solder’d up with base, nay faulty,
Yet necessary functions: . . .
Each hath strong use, as poison in all purges.
Lines 61-2, and 64.
. . some must lie,
Some must betray, some murder, . . .
1f treachery in state be serviceable,
Let hangmen do it.-—Lines 62-3‚ and 81-2.

Lords, ne’er mistrust,
That he who’ll not betray a private man
For his country, will ne'er betray his country
For private men 3—Lines 77-9.

Our vows, our saith, our oaths, why they ’re ourselves,
And he that 's faithless to his proper sels
May be excus'd if he break saith with princes.—Lines 84-6.

Doubt you that old Gelosso can bc vile?
States may affiict‚ tax, torture, but our minds
Are only sworn to Jove.—Lines 126-8.

Yet when some violent chance shall force a state
To break given faith, or plot some stratagems‚
Princes ascribe that vile necessity

Unto Heaven’s wrath. And sure, though 't be no vice
Yet ’tis bad chance ι states must not stick too nice, διε.

Lines 65—9.

For this information I am indebted to Mr. K. Deigh-
ton. It is a much better and more valuable parallel
than any I have been able to bring to light :—-

Massinissa. To doubt of what shall be, is wretchedness :
