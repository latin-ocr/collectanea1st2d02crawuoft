This sentence occurs in the Essays, Book III. chap. v.
p. 448, col. 1, the reference being to Cor. Gal. El„
Ι. 183.

We can confidently assume that Marston did not
consult the original in the above case3 and it is still
more unlikely that he went to St. Jerome for the fol-
lowing, which Montaigne cites in the same chapter,
p. 438, col. 2 :—-

Diaboli virtus in lumbis est.'——“The Dutch courtezan‚’‘ 11. i. 92.
Now, this quotation from St. Jerome comes imme-
diately after matter in Montaigne that Marston has
copied literally in The Fuwn, III. i. 227-36‚ as will
appear in the proper place.

Following the saying of St. Jerome is the question
of Malheureux as to whether or not a wise man may
be in love3 and then we come to Freevill's saying
about living upon the smoke of roast—meat. As I
have shown already, both passages copy Montaigne,
still the same chapter—

Freevill. No matter, sir; insufficiency and sottishness are much
commendable in a most discommendable action.——Ll. 115-17.

Literally from Montaigne, same book and chapter:—

And yet if Ι were to beginne anew, it should bee by the very same
path and progresse, how fruitlesse soever it might proove unto me,
inszqfficicncy and sottishnesse are commendable in a discommendable action.—
P. 453, col. 2.

Montaigne says that love “is a matter everywhere
