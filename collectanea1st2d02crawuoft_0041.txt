bery, murder, treason, which deeds must needs be far more loathsome
than an act which is so natural, just, and necessary, as that of pro-
creation ; you shall have an hypocritical vestal virgin speak that with
close teeth publicly, which she will receive with open mouth privately3
sae—“The Dutch Courtezan‚’‘ ΙΙΙ. i.

The worst of my actions or condicions seeme not so ugly unto me
as 1 finde it both ugly and base not to dare to avouch thern. Every
one is wary in the confession ; we should be as heady in the action.—
Book 111. chap. v. p. 429, col. 2.

Crispinella. I give thoughts words, and words truth‚ and truth bold-
ness: she whose honest freeness makes it her virtue to speak what
she thinks will make it her necessity to think what is good.—“The
Dutch Courtezan,” ΙΙΙ. i. 39-42.

*Is it not herein as in matters of books, which being once called in
and forbidden, become more saleable and publik ?—-Book ΙΙΙ. chap. v.
p. 431, col. 1.

Crispinella. 1 love no prohibited things, and yet 1 would have no-
thing prohibited by policy, but by virtue 3 for as in the fashion of time
those books that are call’d in are most in sale and request, so in nature
those actions that are most prohibited are most desired.—-“The Dutch
Courtezan‚” ΙΙΙ. i. 42-7.

1 love a lightsome and civil discretion, and loathe a roughnes and
austerity of behaviour. . . . Socrates had a constant countenance‚ but
lightsome and smyling: not frowardly constant, as old Crassus, who
was never seen to laugh. Vertue is a pleasant and buxom quality.—
Book ΙΙΙ. chap. v. p. 429, col. z.

Crispinella. Fie, fie! virtue is a free, pleasant, buxom quality. 1
love a constant countenance we113 but this froward ignorant coyness,
sour austere lumpish uncivil privateness‚ that promises nothing but
rough skins and hard stools; ha! fie on’t‚ good for nothing but for
nothing.-“The Dutch Courtezan,” 111. i. 51-6.
