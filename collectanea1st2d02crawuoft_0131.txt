phrasing. The joke is as good as that furnished by
Dr. Theobald, who is so badly informed as to wish
us to believe that the exclamation “What else ! '’ is
not current Elizabethan speech. There is a saying,
“Ye do not believe because ye have not read.”
They trifle with us.

Now we come to something interesting, which
proves how sadly Baconians are neglecting their real
work in the vain and ridiculous attempt to foist the
work of Shakespeare on Bacon. The entry in the
P7·omus‚ from a Baconian point of view, and from the
scholar's point of view as well, is simply invaluable,
for it decisively proves one ofthe so-called “ spurious '’
Apophthegms to be genuine. I could prove that several
others are genuine, but must content myself with the
one that is related to the saying of Sir Thomas More.
Look closely at the Pramus entry once more, and see
how it is exactly repeated in the following :—

my Lord of Leicester concerning two persons whom the queen seemed
to think well of : “By my troth, my lord,’' said he, “the one is a grave
counsellor‚ the other is a properyoung man,· and so he will be as long as
he lives.''

Hence the entry in the Promus proves the genuine-
ness of the Apophthegm‚ and the similarity in the
sayings shows plainly that the saying of Sir Thomas
More was known to Bacon's father as well as to him-
