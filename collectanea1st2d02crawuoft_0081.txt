strongest assertions, which, moreover, prove them to
be very badly versed in Elizabethan literature. In-
deed, Ι shall have to prove that they are not only ill
acquainted with contemporary writings‚ but that they
do not even know the work of their own master—
Bacon. In the course of my arguments I shall show
that if Bacon wrote anything for the stage at all, in
addition to masques, inquirers who are eager to add
to his honours are making a great mistake in troubl-
ing themselves about the work of Shakespeare—they
ought to try Ben Jonson. There is a really wonder—
ful field open for Baconian speculation in the work-—
or, for the sake of the argument, the supposed work
—of Ben Jonson, and ifwhat Ι have to say concern-
ing it has the effect of absorbing some of the super-
abundant energy of Bacon's eager followers, I shall
consider that the time I have devoted to this matter
has not been spent quite in vain.

Ciphers, anagrams, and cryptograms are, I regret

to say, things with which I am not competent to
deal——

Qae supra nos nihil ad nos.

Things above us are not for us; such lofty matter I
shall leave severely alone; but if after what I allege
it can be clearly proved that Bacon used his ciphers
in Shakespeare's work, then nothing will be proved
