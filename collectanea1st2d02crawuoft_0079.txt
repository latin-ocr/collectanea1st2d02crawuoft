We seem ambitious God’s whole work to undo3
Of nothing He made us, and we strive too

To bring ourselves to nothing back.
“Anatomy', First Ann.,” ll. 155-7.

I have occupied a great deal of space to prove very
little, which may be summed up once more in a sen-
tence t certain coincidences in Webster and Marston
are not to be explained on the ground that one writer
borrowed from the other, but that both copied Mon-
taigne3 and it is more reasonable to conclude that
The Dur-hess ofMalfi and A Monumental Column were
written concurrently or nearly so, and in 1613, than
to suppose that the two pieces are separated from each
other by a number of years, I have closely scru-
tinized all dated work of Webster’s authors that I
could find, but not one of such works has yielded me
the shade of a shadow of evidence that The Duchess
ofMalfi was written after 1613. But I have proved
that it must have been written after Prince Henry’s
death, November ξ), 1612.
