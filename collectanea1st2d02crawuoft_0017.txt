THE following pages are intended principally to
show the influence of Florio’s translation of the

essays of Montaigne on Webster in the composition
of The W bite Devil and The Duchess of Malfi, and
therefore are really a continuation of the paper on Sir
Philip Sidney and Webster (Collectanea‚ First Series,
pp. 20-46). But on account of the repetition of cer-
tain matter in The W bite Devil that had appeared
previously in Marston’s The Fam, Ι have had to turn
aside and examine the latter play, because it is assumed
that Webster copied Marston. My inquiries have
been rewarded with a larger measure of success than
I could have hoped for, and now I am in a position
to prove that not only did Webster and Marston ob-
tain the repeated matter, independently of each other,
from Montaigne‚ but that both dramatists are under
a very heavy debt of obligation to Florio’s translation
of the essays.

As regards Dr. Donne, I rely upon his evidence
to fix a nearer date for The Duchess of M alfi than has

as yet been claimed for it with any show of probability.
