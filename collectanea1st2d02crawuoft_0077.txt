Webster's tales ofwhat he had either heard or read,
or even seen, must nearly always be taken with a
grain of salt. The Pope, he sayS, was cured of a
deep melancholy by watching the antics of mad-
men ; the spectacle

forc'd him to laugh‚
And so the imposthume broke.
‘⁴ Duchess of Malfi‚” IV. ii. 51-2‚ p. 86, col. 2.

The cure was devised by “a great physician.'’ But
see Donne :—

When no physician of redress can speak,
A joyful casual violence may break
A dangerous aposthume in thy breast.
“Anatomy, Second Ann.,” ll. 477-9.

Webster says of Prince Henry that

We stood as in some spacious theatre,
Musing what would become of him, his flight
Reach’d such a noble pitch above our sight, &c.
“A Monumental Column,” 11. 48-50.

And he follows up this statement by a reference to
an age of golden dreams. So in Donne :—

She, to whom all this world was but a stage,
Where all sat hearkening how her youthful age
Should be employ’d, because in all she did
Some figure of the golden times was hid.
“Anatorny‚ Second Ann.,'' ll. 67-70.
