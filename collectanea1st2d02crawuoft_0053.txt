Verily according to the lawe which nature giveth them, it is not
fit for them [women] to will and desire: their part is to beare, to
obey, and to consent. Therefore hath nature bestowed a perpetuall
capacity3 on us [men] a seld and uncertaine ability. They have al-
wayes their houre, that they may ever be ready to let us enters——
Book 111. chap. v. p. 450, col. 2.

Hercules. 0, sir, Nature is a wise workman. She knows right well
that if women should woo us to the act of love, we should all be ut-
terly shamed. How often should they take us unprovided, when they
are always ready !—-“The Fawn,” IV. i. 1 36-40.

In his ship of fools Marston has found a place for

some philosophers, and a few critics 3 one of which critics has lost his
flesh with fishing at the measure of Plautus’ verses 3 another has vow⁷d
to get the consumption of the 1ungs, or to leave to posterity the true
orthography and pronunciation of laughing3 a third hath melted a
great deal o’ suet, worn out his thumbs with turning, read out his
eyes, and studied his face out of a sanguine into a meagre‚ spawling,
fleamy loathsomeness‚—and all to find but why mentula should be the
feminine gender, since the rule is, Propria quae maribus tribuuntur
mascula dicas.——“The Fawn‚” IV. i. 218-28.

This gird at fantastical scholars is a close imitation
of Montaigne :—

This man, whom about mid-night, when others take their rest,
thou seest come out of his study, meagre looking, with eyes trilling,
flegmatick‚ squalide, and spauling, doest thou thinke that plodding on
his books he doth seek how he shall become an honester man, or
more wisc, or more content? There is no such matter. He wil
either die in his pursuit, or teach posteritie the measure of Plautus
verses and the true orthography of a Latine word.—Book Ι. chap.
xxxviii. p. 110, col. z.
