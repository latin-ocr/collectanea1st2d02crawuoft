Montaigne says :—

To forbid us anything is the ready way to make us long for it.—
Book 11. chap. xv. p. 315, col. 1.

[Love is] a pleasure inflamed by difficulty-*Book 111. chap. v. p.

col. 1.
434‘l'he price or honor of the conquest is rated by the difficultie.--
Book III. chap. v. p. 439, col. 1.

It is against the nature of love not to be violent, and against the
condition of violence to be constant.-—Book 111. chap. ν. p. 451, col. 1.

Thus in Marston :—

Philocalia. But, dear madam, your reason of loving him?
Dulcimel. Faith‚ only a woman's reason, because I was expressly
forbidden to love him . . .

Phi. But, when you saw no means of manifesting your affection
to him, why did not your hopes perish?

Dul. O Philocalia Ε that difficulty only enflames me: when the
enterprise is easy, the victory is inglorious . . .

Phi. O love, how violent are thy passages!

Dul. Pish‚ Philocalia! ’tis against the nature of love not to be
violent.

Phi. And against the condition of violence to be constant.—“ The
Fawn,’' III. i. 242-73.

The source of Gonzago's remarks concerning lies,
in III. i. 420-23, is dealt with on p. 14.

As I shall be dealing presently with the passage in
Montaigne that is supposed to have been copied from

Marston by Webster, I will anticipate matters here
by showing further resemblanees between The W hite

Devil and the Essays.

Marston may or may not have got a hint from

W ebster‚

and
