Karol. Why do you so survey and circumscribe me,
As if you struck one eye into my breast‚
And with the other took my whole dimensions?
“The Sad Shepherd‚’' Act 111.

The saying is put in a very funny way in Two Wise
M cn and all the Rest Fools, a play attributed to George
Chapman3 but as Chapman became one of Bacon’s
masks after the death of Marlowe, I forbear to quote
the passage. Bacon may be the author of the play,
as he undoubtedly was the continuator of Hero ancl
Leander.

That one man’s folly or imperfection is but another
man’s fable is proverbial, and as good examples of the
saying can be found in Jonson's The Fax, The Staple

ofNews, and other plays by the same author as have
been adduced from Shakespeare.

The following contains a Pramus proverb which
Bacon does not use, nor is it alluded to in Shakespeare.
It is rarely referred to by Elizabethan writers :—

Dauphine. How now, Cutbeard ! succeeds it, or no?
Cur. Past imagination, sir, onmia secunda 3 you could not have pray'd
to have had it so well. Saltat senex, as it is in the proverb.
“The Silent Woman,” 11. iv.

On the other hand, Shakespeare will sometimes
make use of a saying in the Pramus which is rarely
used in the same form by others of the time3 but
Baconians do not always discover these parallels. For
instance, in the folio version of 2 Henry VI.‚ ΙΙ. i. 24,

U
