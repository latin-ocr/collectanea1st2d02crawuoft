and it occurs many times in Chaucer. “Real,'' as
opposed to “nominal,'' was also in use in England
long before Bacon was born, as witness the opposing
sects of the Nominalists and the Realists. The
Spanish coin, a reale, was also well known to English—
men before Bacon's time. Yet Mrs. Pott, mistaking
the object of Bacon's note, which is revealed by the
entry that he places under it, “Forma dat esse,”
makes a parade of the fact that Shakespeare uses
“royal'’ for “real‚” that he puns upon the coins
“noble” and “1·eal‚'' and that he employs “real ’²
in the sense of being opposed to “unreal.’' Shake-

Host. My lord, there is a nobleman would speak to you.

P. Hen. Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and
send him back.—“ 1 Henry 1V.⁷’ Act 11. sc. iv.
Mrs. Pott does not attempt to show that Bacon any—

word “real,” and she overlooks the fact that the
dramatists of the time were often guilty of making
most wretched puns on the names of coins. It was
a common device to play on “a11gels,'’ “ducats,’' &c.
Thus in The First Part ofseronimo‚ Kyd has several
nonsensical puns on “ ducats,’' which become “ducks,
dainty ducks ”3 and in Sir John Oldcastle and in many
