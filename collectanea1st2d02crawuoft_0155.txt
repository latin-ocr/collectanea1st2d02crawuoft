Os valour 1 speak not ς take it from the witnesses that have been
produced before ι yet, the old observation is not untrue, that the
Spaniard's valour lieth in the eye of the looker-on; but the English
valour lieth about the soldier's heart.—“Of a War with Spain.'’

Four passages are quoted from Shakespeare to show
that he uses the form “lies in,'’ but the only one that
is worth noticing is the following :—

A Jest’s prosperity lies in the ear
of him that hears it ; never in the tongue
Of him that makes it.
“Love's Labour Lost‚⁷' V. ii. 869—71.

Let us try Jonson ;--

Lord Β. But the ignorant valour,
That knows not why it undertakes, but doth it
To escape the infamy merely—

Lovel. Is worst of all :
That valour lies in the eyes o' the lookers-on,
And is called valour with a witness.

“The New Inn,'' IV. iii.

Dr. Theobald makes the point that both Shake-
speare and Bacon call Ulysses “sly”; but others do
the same, including Ben Jonson :—

As by Polypheme
The sly Ulysses stole in a sheep-skin.
“Epigrams‚” No. ¹23·

γ And he also thinks it notable that they should agree
in connecting the word “sleight’' with the same
personage. “False Ulysses’ sleight'' is a phrase in
Surrey's translation of the AEneid3 and in the first

The

Bucon-

Shakespeare
¹chstion.
