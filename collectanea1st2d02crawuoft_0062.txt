ton makes Gelosso adopt a similar attitude towards
the proposal of the Senate, who had decreed the same
treacherous death for Massinissa. The closeness with
which the play follows the essay renders it probable
that the incident in Sophonisba was really suggested
by Montaigne. To give samples of the manner in
which Marston copies, I will quote the following:

Montaigne. . . . thus left he [Tiberius] the profitable for the
honest . . . there is nothing in nature unserviceable, no not inutility
itself3 . . . In matter of policy likewise some necessary functions
are not onely base, but faulty vices finde therein a seate, and employ
themselves in the stitching up of our frame3 as poysons in the pre-
servation of our health. . . . The Commonwealth requireth some to
betray, some to lie, and some to massaker : leave we that commission
to people more obedient and more pliable. . . . 1 answered not long
since, that hardly could I betray my Prince for a particular man, who
should be very sorry to betray a particular man for my Prince. . . .
Who is unfaithfull to himselfe may be excused if hee be saithlesse to
his master. . . . “You may impose as heavy burdens, and harmfull
taxes upon us as you please, but you lose your time to command us
any shamefull or dishonest things.'’ . . . When an urgent circumstance,
or any violent or unexpected accident, induceth a prince for the ne-
cessitie of his estate, or as they say for state matters, to breake his
worde and saith, or otherwise forceth him out of his ordinary duty,
hee is to ascribe that necessity unto a lash of Gods rod. It is no vice,
for hee hath quit his reason unto a reason more publike and more

powerfull.—Pages 402-7.
In Marston thus :—

Profit and honesty are not in one state.—-Line 14.

Nothing in Nature is unserviceable,
No, not even inutility mels-‘Lines 56-7.
