other plays money is given the cant name of “golden
ruddocks ‘' or “robin-redbreasts.'’ Hence Shakespeare
was but following a general lead, and there is nothing
unusual or strange in his pun, supposing him to be
connecting “royal'' with the Spanish “reale’'—a
point which is open to serious question. He may
have merely meant “royal’' to stand for “kingly‚''
or something greater in rank than a “nobleman.’'
“ Royal ’³ in this sense is used in a somewhat similar
passage by Massinger, and in relation to money:—

Wellborn. 1 will pay you in private.
Order. A royal gentleman l
Furnace. Royal as an emperor ἔ
He’ll prove a brave master; my good lady knew
To choose a man.

“A New way to pay Old Debts‚” Act IV. sc. ii.

The Fable of Cupid, as told by Bacon, and his inter-
pretation of it, explain the precise use to which he
meant to put his note, for there and elsewhere he
associates the scholastic “real’' with the Platonic
dictum “Forma dat esse,'’ as well as with his other
Pramus note, No. 765, “He came of an egge.’'
Now if there were no other evidence to disprove
Bacon's title to the Shakespeare plays and poems it
could be found in this word “real‚” for, strange to
say, it seems to have almost completely dropped out
of common speech for at least fifty years before it
