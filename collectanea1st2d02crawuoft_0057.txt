for the onely pleasure of murther would commit it ς then cut, mangle,
and hacke other members in pieces : to rouze and sharpen their wits‚
to invent unused tortures and unheard-oftorments 3 to devise new and
unknowne deaths, and that in cold blood, without any former enmitie
or quarrell, or without any gaine or profit 3 and onely to this end, that
they may enjoy the pleasing spectacle of the languishing gestureS, piti-
full motions, horror-moving yellings, deep fetcht groanes, and lament-
able voyces of a dying and drooping man. For that is the extremest
point whereunto the crueltie of man may attaine.—Book ΙΙ. chap. xi.

Cuckolds‚ who publish their shame to the world,
are fools: they should rather wink at faults than ex-
pose them :—

Curiosity is everywhere vicious, but herein pernicious. It is meere
solly for one to seeke to be resolved of a doubt, or search into a mis—
chiefe, for which there is no remedie, but makes it worse, but festereth
the same ε the reproach whereofis increased, and chiefely published by
jealousie3 and the revenge whereof doth more wound and disgrace
our children then it helpeth or graceth us.—Book III. chap. v. p. 422,
col. 1.

Hercules. In all things curiosity hath been
Vicious at least, but herein most pernicieuS.
What madness is ’t to search and find a wound
For which there is no cure, and which unfound
Ne‘er rankles, whose finding only wounds?

But he that upon vain surmise forsakes
His bed thus long, only to search his shame ;
Gives to his wife youth, opportunity,
Keeps her in idleful deliciousness,
Heats and inflames imagination,
Provokes her to revenge with churlish wrongs‚—
What should he hope but this?
