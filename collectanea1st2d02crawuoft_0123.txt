The Discoveries that are mingled in this quotation
are headed Ingeniorum Discrimina and C estius.-—-C icero,
ἃς. Other parts of the quotation parallel Bacon’s
work, but I will now deal with the concluding sen-
tence only. In the Discoveries the passage runs

thus :—-

But in these things the unskilful are naturally deceived, and judg-
ing wholly by the bulk, think rude things greater than polished 3 and
scattered more numerous than composed.

Jonson here distinctly alludes to the Baconian
“colour,” with its reprehension that

that which consists of more parts, and those divisible, is greater, and
more one than what is made up of fewer3 for all things when they
are looked upon piecerneal seem greater3 when also a plurality of
parts make a show of bulk considerable, which a plurality of parts
affects more strongly, if they be in no certain order3 for it then

resembles an infinity, and hinders the comprehending of them.—

“egl-oms of Good and Evil‚” v.‚ and “De Aug.‚” Book VI. c. iii.
sop lsm xn.

That there can be no manner of doubt about the
allusion is further proved by the concluding Discover-
ies, which go under the general title Ofthe Magnitude
ancl Compass ofany Fable, Epic or Dramatic. These
latter boldly copy Bacon's colour and its answer
throughout. But the passages are too long to quote
here, and therefore Ι must leave readers to compare
the two authors for themselves, and turn to other
matter which is capable of more concise treatment.
