Donne are of some value as evidence, otherwise they montaigne,
would not have obtained the dignity of recognition Web-‘ter’
from such a ripe and cultured Elizabethan and Jaco- (md
bean scholar as Mr. McKerrow. One or two of Marsum?
of these parallels are repeated in A MonumentalColumn, &s-

and that circumstance is of great importance in the

discussion as to the date of The Duchess ofMalfi.

Donnc’s Anatomy, we know, cannot be dated earlier

than 1612 ς and A Monumental Column could not, of

necessity, have been commenced until after Novem-

ber 6 of the same year, when Prince Henry died. As

Webster’s poem and play borrow from Donne, and

as they use precisely the same language and figures,

besides taking in a literal form material from the

same authors, such as Sir Philip Sidney, Montaigne,

Ben Jonson, and George Chapman, they must both

have been composed after the death of Prince Henry,

and at or about the same time. This conclusion is

warranted by an examination of Webster’s work as

a whole, and it is broad-sealed by the evidence of

Donne. It is further corroborated by another book-

let of George Chapman's, also published in 1612,

under the title Petrarchs Seven Penetentiall Psalm5‚

&c. As a matter of fact, I ought to have added
Chapman’s name to the title of these articles, but left

it out for brevity's sake.
