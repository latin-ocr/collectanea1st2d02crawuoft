No, it is you poore jobus, that with your painted consciences have
coloured the religion of divers, spreading through the veynes of the
Commonwealth like poyson, the doggednes of your devotion53 which
entring in like the smoothnes of oyle into the flesh, fretteth in time
like quicksilver into the bones.

Because the tract repeats over and over again the
pet phrases and proverbs of John Lyly, and because
its general style bears more than a passing resemblance
to that author's‚ critics have assigned it to Lyly.
Other circumstances seem to lend colour to the cor-
rectness of the attribution. But how easily the best
men may err ! “Things that seem are not the same '’
(see Peele's Old Wives’ Tale, Dyce, p. 447, col. 2).
The real author is Francis Bacon. If further proof
be required, a comparison of the pamphlet with
Bacon's known work will yield evidence in his favour
in abundance. For instance, Promus, No. 909, is
“The crowe of the belfry’'; and No. 536 reads
“Allow no swallow under thy roof.’' Puppe with
an Hatchet dilates on both proverbs, and shows that
they have a common reference to busy, malevolent
persons, who spread slanders, and, like the chattering
birds of the fables, leave nothing but filth in the places
that gave them a kindly shelter. There are many
allusions to the same proverbs in Ben Jonson. Again,
the tract quotes the Latin sentence: “Discite justi-
tiam moniti, et non temnere divos.” This sentence
