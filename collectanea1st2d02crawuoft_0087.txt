the preceding instance, were peculiar to Shakespearc
and Bacon 3 and she goes further than this, for in her
preface, p. 50, she asserts that the word “avenues”
is not only not in Shakespeare, but it is absent also
from Bacon’s prose work. I will quote from Bacon,
and it will be seen that he not only has a fixed way
of employing the word, but that he always associates
it with the words “approaches” or “entrances.'’

1. “Since the last parhoment, it is also notorious in every man's
knowledge and remembrance that the Spaniards have possessed thern—
selves of that avenne and place of approach for England‚’' ἀς.-
“Spu-ech on the Subsidy b'ill‚'’ 1597.

2. “How great the honour is, to keep the approaches or avenues
01' this kingdom, Ι hear many discourse.''—-“Advice to Essex,’' March,

ι599·

3. “If physicians will learn and use the true approaches and avenues
of nature,⁷’ &c.——“Advancen1ent of Learning‚” Book II.

4. “But their approaches and avenues are taken away.”—“Gen-
eral Naturalization,'’ February, 1606-7.

5. “Causeways in the avenues and entrances of the towns abroad
beyond the seas.”—“Charge on Opening the Court of the Verge,'⁷
161 1.

Other cases could be cited to show that Bacon em-
ploys the word in the same very peculias way.
Then there is the word “ real,” which is put under
No. 461, and which Mrs. Pott thinks Bacon may
have introduced into the English language. “ Real‚”
in the sense of “royal,” was a common word in
