parallel The White Devil, 1. 2259, p. 34, col. 2 :—

He spreads his bounty with a sowing hand.

and they remind one of Massinger‚ who uses the
figure in almost the same' form so many times that
it has lost its nap. However, the line in The White
Devil apparently occurs in one of the productioris of
Beaumont and Fletcher, for it is quoted, but without
references, by George Darley, in his Introduction to
the works of those authors, p. 10.

Lines 43-6,

He was not like the mad and thriftless vine
That spendeth all her blushes at one time,

But like the orange-trec his fruits he bore,—
Some gather'd, he had green, and blossoms store.

Bosola tells us that

The orange-trec bears ripe and green fruit and blossoms all to-
gether: &c.——“The Duchess of Malfi‚‘’ 11. ii., 15-7‚ p. 69, col. 1.

and Bosola is corroborated by Bacon :—

There be divers fruit trees in the hot countries, which have blos-
soms, and young fruit, and ripe fruit, almost all the year succeeding
one another. And it is said the orange hath the like with us for a
great part of summer, and so also hath the fig.

As Montaigne is responsible for many of the good
things that appear in The Duchess of Maffi, it would
be very surprising if we did not find a trace of the
French philosopher in the elegy. And we are not
disappointed. Montaigne says :—
