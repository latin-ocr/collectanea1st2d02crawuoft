searched for a trace of Sidney’s book in The White
Devil. The inference I draw is that Webster wrote
the latter play before he became possessed of a copy
of The Arcadia, and, consequently, this negative bit
of testimony bears out the received opinion that The
W hite Devil is an earlier work than The Duchess of
Malfi.

But, if the evidence of Florio is not very helpful
in the dating of Webster’s work, it is certainly of
some value when applied to the work of Marston.
Is not it of interest to know that these essays, which
were published in 1603, are copied over and over
again in The Dutch marazan, 1605, The Fatum,
1606, and Sophonisba, published in the same year?

I will now deal with some of the less valuable
evidence that has come into my hands reserving more
important matter for later pages3 and I shall mingle
the parallels with Montaigne in Webster and Marston
as a preliminary in proof of my statement that both
dramatists copied from Florio’s book independently
of each other. The editionsI quote from are Prof.
Henry Morley's reprint of Florio’s M ontaigne, Dyce’s
Webster and Mr. Bullen’s Marston. Ι will give page
and column as well as other references for the Mon-
taigne and Webster quotations.
