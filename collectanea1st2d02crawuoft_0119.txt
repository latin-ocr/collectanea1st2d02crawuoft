must have written everything that had been written
up to his time and during the time that he lived. Is
it any wonder, the-n, that the critics who work upon
such a plan as that, and who, just as the ostrich when
it sees an enemy buries its head in the sand, refuse
to read or else ignore the writings of all other men
because they would convict thern, confining their
reading to Shakespeare and Bacon—is it any wonder
that they are able to present a specious case against
Shakespeare and impose on men who either have not
the time or lack the critical faculty to see through
their false and preposterous resemblances? Bacon
calls that kind ofwork legerdemain, and he compares
it to the tricks of tumblers, who only thrive till their
tricks are known.

The Baconian parallels prove nothing, except that
Shakespeare and Bacon made use of the same pro-
verbs‚ phrases, and learning as were current in all
writings of the time. They do not even prove that
either writer was ever aware of the work performed
by the other3 and such evidence as has been adduced
to connect the two is not nearly of such force as the
evidence that could be marshalled from such writers
as Sir Philip Sidney‚ John Lyly, or Beaumont and
Fletcher, besides others who could be named, who

were either read by Bacon, or were impressed by
what he had written.
