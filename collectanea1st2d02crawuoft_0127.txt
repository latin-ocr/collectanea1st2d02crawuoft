their marvellous assortment of Bacon-Shakespcare
parallels, which no scales will ever be able to weigh
properly. I will assist them, and illustrate Bacon by
Jonson at the same time :—

It is hard in all causes, but especially in matters ofreligion‚ when

voices shall be numbered and not weighed.—“Controversies os the
Chu1*ch,’' 1589.

Suffrages in parliament are numbered‚ not weighed.—--“Discoveries:
Con1it.,‘' διε.

In his Notesfor an Interview with the King, March,
1621-2‚ Bacon employs another Promus note :—

Of my offence, far be it from me to say, dat veniam corvis, vexa!
censura columbas.

The sentence is from Juvenal, and it occurs in Jon—
son :—

The net was never spread for the hawk or buzzard that hurt us,
but for the harmless bird83 they are good meat: Dat veniam corvis,
vexat censura columbas.—“ Discoveries : Fures publici.”

In his Apophthegms Bacon relates the story of the
feast at Athens at which Zeno made his memorable
reply to the ambassador who asked him what he
should say to his master concerning him (Zeno) :—

Report to your lord, that there are of the Grecians that can hold
their peace.

Jonson relates the same story in the Discoveries:
Homeri Ulysse53 and it is to be found in almost the
same words in John Lyly’s Euphues, Arber, p. 146.
