He uses this note in the Advancement ofLearning,
in the De Augmentis, in Filum Labyrinthi, twice in
the Interpretation of Nature, and twice in the Novum
Organum, besides elsewhere3 and each time that he
uses it he does so in a fixed manner. In the Novum
Organum, he, in 3 manner, excuses his fondness for
the illustration, for he brings it in with the remark
“to use a common allusion of ours.” The follow-
ing quotation shows how Bacon uses his Promus
jottings :—

“But here by use and action, we do not mean the applying of
knowledge to lucre, for that diverts the advancement of knowledge,
as the golden ball thrown before Atalanta, which, while she stoops to
take up, the race is hindered.

Declinat cursus, aurumque volubile tollit.”
“Advancement of Learning,’' Book Ι.

Surely, if Bacon wrote Shakespeare, we should be
able to find something better to fit the Promus entry
than the following, which Mrs. Pott, who forgot,
or did not know, that Bacon used his note, and used
it often, adduces from the plays: “You have a nimble
wit : I think 'twas made of Atalanta’s heels’' (As You
Like It, Act III. sc. ii.).

Resides, among Shakespeare’s contemporaries the
allusion to the fable is very common, Lyly referring
to it many times. Here is one case :—

“ Let Atalanta runne never so swistelye, shee will looke back upon
Hyppomanes.”——“Euphues and his England,’' 1580.
