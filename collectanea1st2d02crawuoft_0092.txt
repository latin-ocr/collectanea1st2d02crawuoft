words against those who do not desire real know—

Shakespeare's time, who produced anything like the
same volume of work as he did, or something approach-

many times.

But there are certain turns of speech noted by
Bacon which are far from common in the literature
of the time, and although these are habitually used
by Bacon, they are altogether absent from Shake-
