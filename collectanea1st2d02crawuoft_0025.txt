As an attentive angler,
Fixing his steady eyes on the swift streams
Osa steep tumbling torrent, no sooner turns
His sight to land, but giddy, thinks the firm banks
And constant trees, move like the running waters:
So you, &c-

Monticelso. Why did the Duke of Florence with such care
Labour your pardon? Say.

Lodovico. Italian beggars will resolve you that,
Who, begging of an alms, bid those they beg of
Do good for their own sakes, &a
“The White Devil‚’' ll. 2254-8‚ p. 34, col. 2.
The origin of Lodovico’s allusion is clear :—

1 had much rather not to live at all then to live by almes. I
would I had the priviledge to demande of them, in the same stile I
have heard some beg in Italy: Fare bene per voi.- “Do some good for
your selfe.‘'——Book III. chap. v. p. 455, col. 2.

I said in my article on Sir Philip Sidney and
Webster that it is more than probable that the repe-
titions that have been noticed in Webster by various
editors are due to notes taken by the author in his
various readings. Here is another case to support
my opinion. Montaigne says :—

We share the fruits of our prey with our dogges and hawkes, as a
rneed of their paine and reward of their industry.—Book ΙΙ. c. xii.
p. 232, col. 1.

Vit. Cor. Your dog or hawk should be rewarded better
Than 1 have been.
“The White Devi1,'’ ll. 2098-9‚ p. 32, col. 1.
