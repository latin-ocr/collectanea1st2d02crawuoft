The parallel to Act V. sc. i. ll. 28—37, has already
been recorded on p. 5.

Ι can never forget this good saying ι lactantius moerent, quae minus
dolent.- “They keepe a howling with most ostentation who are less
sorrowfull at heart.“ Their lowring and puling is hatefull to the
living and vaine to the dead. Wee shall easily dispence with them
to laugh at us when we are dead, upon condition they smile upon us
while wee live. Is not this the way to revive a man with spite 3 that
he who hath spitten in my face when 1 was living shall come and
claw my feet when 1 am dead ?—Book 11. chap. xxxv. p. 378, col. 2.

Tysqfew. Is not this better than louring and pouting and puling‚
which is hateful to the living and vain to the dead ? Come, come,
you must live by the quick, when all is done3 and for my own part,
let my wife laugh at me when I am dead, so she'll smile upon me
whilst Ι live : but to see a woman whine, and yet keep her eyes dry:
mcum, and yet keep her cheeks fat ε nay, to see a woman claw her
husband by the feet when he is dead, that would have scratched him
by the face when he was living—this now is somewhat rediculous.———
“The Dutch Courtezan,'’ V. ii. 80—90.

For the parallel to Act V. sc. iii. ll. 68-81, see
p. 4.

I turn now to The Fawn.

Montaigne, praising the Emperor Maximilian,
says:—

“Contrarie to other Princes, who to dispatch their weightiest
affaires make often their close-stoole their regall Throne or Council-

Chamber‚ [he] . . . would not permit any groome of his chamber
(were he never so neere about him) to see him in his inner chamber,

&c. —Book Ι. chap. iii. p. 7, col. 1.
