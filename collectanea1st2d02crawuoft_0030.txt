Florio translates as under :—

To lie is a horrible filthy vice 3 and which an ancient writer setteth
forth very shamefully, when he saith that whosoever lieth witnesseth
that he contemneth God and therewithall men. It is impossible more
richly to represent the horrour, the vilenesse and the disorder of it ε
for what can be imagined so vile and base as to be a coward towards

Is full of base, ignoble cowardice‚
Since 'tis most plain, such speeches do contemn

Heaven and fear men (that’s sententious now).
“The Fawn,” III. i. 420—3.

tresses with sear and trembling3 and before their Maker‚ like impu-
dent mountains l—“Every Man out of his Hu1nour‚’' III. iii.

success of Julia's suit, is naturally indignant with
his friend, who denied his request and yet gave the
citadcl to such a creature as Julia. But Pescara
replies:—
