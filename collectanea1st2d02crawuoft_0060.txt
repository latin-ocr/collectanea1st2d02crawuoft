speech of Hercules, in V. i. of the same play, from
lines 15-20‚ is almost literally from Book II. chap.
xv. p. 315, col. 1. At the end of Hercules’ speech
Dondolo enters laughing :-—

Hercules. Why dost laugh‚ fool, here ’s nobody with thee?
Dondolo. Why, therefore, do Ι laugh, because there ’s nobody with

Ι. ii.‚ he tears his hair in the extremity of his grief.

Massinissa. Old lord, spate thy hairs z
What, dost thou think baldness will cure thy grief?-Ll. 136-7.

baldnesse will asswage his griefe?”--Book I. chap. iv. p. 9, col. 1.

Scores of such sayings are made use of by Webster,
several of which are contained in Sir Francis Bacon's
Apophthegms, and, what is rather strange, sometimes
in Bacon’s own special phrasing3 but they are brought
