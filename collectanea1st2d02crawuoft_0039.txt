infused, and a cen-tre whereto all lines come, all things
looke.’'—-P. 436, col. 1 .

Freevill. Love is the centre in which all lines close, the common
bond of being.——-Ll. 121—2.

Freevill. Incontinence will force a continence3
Heat wasteth heat, light defaceth light, &c.-—Ll. 126-7.

Nimirum propter continentiam incontinentia necessaria est, incendium
ignibus extinguitur: Belike we must be incontinent that we may be
continent, buming is quenched by fire.”—P. 436, col. 2.

Absentem marmoreamque putes.-—Martial, xi. 60.
Here again Marston and Montaigne cite the same
passage, the latter in p. 449, col. 1, and the former
in 1. 14 5.

Malheureux. To kill my friend 1 O ’tis to kill myself!
Yet man's but man’s excrement-man breeding man
As he does worm53 or this, to spoil this nothing. [He spits.
“The Dutch Courtezan,” 11. ii. 213-15·

Mr. Κ. Deighton thinks that the reading of this
passage should be :—

Yet man’s but excrement—man breeding man,
As he does worms, or this [He spits]‚ to spoil this nothing.
“The Old Dramatists, Conjectural Readings‚⁷' p. 7.

This is the passage which Marston copied :—

There have Philosophers beene found disdaining this naturali con-
junction ε witnesse Aristippus, who being urged with the affection he
ought his children, as proceeding from his loyns, began to spit‚ saying,
That also that excrement proceeded from him, and that also we en-
gendred wormes and lice.—Book 1. chap. xxvii. p. 84, col 1.
