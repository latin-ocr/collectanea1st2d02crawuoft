A quotation from Bacon's “acknowledged work''
will assist us in this part of our inquiryt—

“ Therefore to speak plainly of the gathering of heads or common-

gestion it gives the render. Next I think no profit is gotten of his
notes that is not judicious in that whereof he makes his notes.”——
“Advice to Sir F. Greville,” about 1596.

The gathering of commonplaces is advocated by
Bacon not only in the advice to Greville, but in
several places in his work, notably in the De Aug-
mentis, book vi. The notes may be commonplaces,
but they must be selected with care and with par-
ticular reference to the suggestions they offer3 for not
only will one man’s notes little profit another, but
the same sayings or sentences will conjure up in
another man's mind quite different trains of thought,
which would be controlled by a different experience
and environment. In other words, so many heads,
so many wits. Now let us compare Bacon’s wit
with Shakespeare’s.

I will first deal with one or two single words that
