as they went forth, because they carried themselves always along with
them.—“The Duchess of Malfi‚” I. i. 43-8, p. 59, col. 2.

We must go to Plato’s great master for illustration
this time :—

It was told Socrates that one was no whit amended by his travell ε
“Ι believe it wel (said he) for he carried himselfe with him.”—-Book

Ι. chap. xxxviii. p. 109, col. 1.

Cicero says :—

Multi fallere docuerunt, dum timent falli, et aliis jus peccandi suspicando
fecerunt: Many have taught others to deceive while themselves

feare to be deceived, and have given them just cause to offend by
suspecting them unjustly.—Book ΙΙΙ. chap. ix. p. 486, col. 1.

Thus in Webster :—

· Bosola. He did suspect me wrongfully.
Ferdinand. For that

You must give great men leave to take their times.

Distrust doth cause us seldom be deceiv’d.

Bos. Yet, take heed ;

For to suspect a friend unworthily
Instructs him the next way to suspect you,
And prompts him to deceive you.

“The Duchess of Malfii,‘’ Ι. i. 278-87‚ p. 62, col. 1.
Bosola has a lively imagination, which leads him
at times to exaggerate very simple facts. Montaigne
has the following, to prove to what lengths some
persons will go to add to their personal charms :—

Who bath not heard of her at Paris, which only to get a fresher
hew of a new skin, endured to have her face flead all over ?-Book Ι.

chap. xl. p. 122, col. 1.
