The saying of Montaigne is paralleled in the same ·’
play, and again in Sophonisba :—

Freevil. . . . in wine, alas for our pity! our throat is but
short ε &c.——“The Dutch Courtezan‚'’ Ι. i. 126.

Syphax. Hence l—stay‚ take thy delight by steps,
Think of thy joys, and make long thy pleasures, &a
“Sophonisba,’' ΙΙΙ. i. 176-7.

Again :—

It is an unpleasing and injurious custome unto ladies, that they
must afford their lips to any man that hath but three lackies follow-
ing him, how unhandsome and lothsome soever he be z

From whose dog nostrils black-blew ice depends‚

Whose beard frost-hardened stands on bristled end8‚ &c-
Nor do we our selves gaine much by it : for as the world is divided
into foure parts, so for foure faire ones we must kiss fiftie foule : and
to a nice or tendet stomack‚ as are those of mine age, one ill kiss doth
surpay one good.—Book ΙΙΙ. chap. v. p. 449, col. 1.

Crispinella. . . . my stomach o’ late stands against kissing
extremely.

Beatrice. Why, good Crispinella?

Crisp. By the saith and trust 1 bear to my face ’tis grown one of
the most unsavoury ceremonies: body o’ beauty ! ’tis one of the most
unpleasing injurious customs to ladies: any fellow that has but one
nose on his face, and standing collar and skirts also lined with taffety
sai-cenet, must salute us on the lips as familiarly——Soft skins save
us! There was a stub-bearded John-a—Stile with a ployden’s face
saluted me last day and struck his bristles through my lips; 1 ha'
spent ten shillings in pomatum since to skin them again. Marsy, if
a nobleman or a knight with one lock visit us, though his unclean
goose-turd—green teeth ha’ the palsy, his nostrils smell worse than a
putrified marrowbonc, and his loose beard drops into our bosom, yet
wc must kiss him with a cursy‚ a curse !-‘⁴The Dutch Courtczan,”

111. ἰ. 7-24.
