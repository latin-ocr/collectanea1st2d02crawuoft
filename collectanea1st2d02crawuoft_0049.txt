Vit. Cor. I prithee, yet remember
Millions are now in graves, which at last day
Like mandrakes shall rise shrieking.

Flam. Leave your prating‚

Feminine arguments ε and they move me,
As some in pulpits move their auditory‚
More with their exclamation than sense
Of reason or sound doctrine.

Lazo-Casa—

Ariosto. I must talk to you like a divine.
Romelio. I have heard

Some talk of it very much, and many times
To their auditors’ impatience.
