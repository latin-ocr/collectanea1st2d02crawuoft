This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without

Why the man dies.
The Pramus note is perfectly explained in Euphues,
Arber, p. 330, which shows that it has particular

reference to the attempt on the life of Jason :—

For as he that stroke Jason on the stomacke to kill him, broke
his impostume with ye blow, whereby he cured him : so oftentimes it
fareth with those that deale malitiously‚ who in steed of a sword apply
a salve, and thinking to be ones Priest, they become his Phisition.

Now, it is quite certain from Lyly that Shake-
speare was not referring to the subject of the Pramus
entry3 but a further reference to Lyly and others
will show that Hamlet and other passages in both
Shakespeare and Bacon merely repeat a metaphor
and phrasing that, strange as it may seem to Bacon-
ians to say so, is common in all Elizabethan writ-
ings.

In the essay of Seditions Bacon says :—

He that turneth the humours back and maketh the wound bleed
inwards endangereth malign ulcers and pernicious imposthumations.

Again, in May, 1610, on the chstion ofreceiving
the King's Message, he says :—

Take away liberty of Parliament, the griefs of the subject will
bleed inwards : sharp and eager humours will not evaporate‚ and then
they must exulcerate, and so may endanger the sovereignty itself.

Baconians imagine the phrase “to bleed inwards'’ to
be one of Bacon’s inventions. Now, the idea of

The
