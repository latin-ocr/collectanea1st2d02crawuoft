The

Bacen-

Shakespeare
chstion .

Baconians apparently do not know that No. 69
forms part of the Antitheta of Envy, that Bacon
again refers to it in the De Aug„ Book VIII. ch. viii„
and that the sentiment itself is extremely common
in both contemporary and earlier writers. And, of
course, we may assume that the verse suggested to
Bacon the masque which he wrote under Jonson’s
name, Pleasure reconciled to V irtue. In the first Essay
ofDeath No. 60 is brought in thus :—

Death hath this also, that it openeth the gate to good fame, and
extinguisheth envy ι Extinctus amabitur idem.

In Jonson's supposed work the two entries are
closely paralleled several times3 and in one place we
find a repetition of Bacon’s own phrasing, which
Gabriel Harvey would dub “as new as Newgate‚’'
but which is really much older :—

Cen. It will open the gate to your fame.
“ The Silent Woman‚” IV. ii.

No. 1 23 is an innocent-looking phrase from Psalm
cxlvii. 16:—
Qi dat nivem sicut lanam.
Yet it is a trap for the unwary Baconian who has
forgotten to read Bacon. It reminds one of the
musty proverb of trying to play Hamlet without
Hamlet. Judge. Mrs.P0tt quotes from Shakespeare

as follows :—
