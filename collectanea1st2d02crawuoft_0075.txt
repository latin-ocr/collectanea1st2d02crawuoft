And the world’s busy noise to overcome,
Took so much death as served for opium.
“Anatomy, A Funeral Elegy‚’' ll. 78-80.

Ant. Her days are practis’d in such noble virtue,

That sure her nights‚ nay, more, her very sleeps,
Are more in heaven than other ladies’ shrifts.

In thy embracements, Ι would have thee build
Such a room for him as our anchorites

To holier uses inhabit.
Act ΙΙΙ. sc. ii. ll. 118-21, p. 76, col. 2.
