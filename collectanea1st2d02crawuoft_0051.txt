The following verse from the AEneid, v. l. 6, is

quoted by Montaigne in Book ΠΙ. chap. v. p. 440,
col. 2, and by Marston in The Fwwn, III. i. 537 :—

Notumque‚ furens quid foemina possit.

We come now to the passage in Marston that
Webster is supposed to have copied. As I have
abundantly proved that both dramatists imitated the
Essays independently of each other, I will merely deal

with the parallels in the ordinary way.

Wishing and enjoying trouble us both alike. The rigor ofa mistris
is yrkesome, but ease and facility (to say true) much more; forasmuch
as discontent and vexation proceed of the estimation we have of the
thing desired, which sharpen love and set it afire. Whereas satiety
begets distaste: it is a dull, blunt, weary, and drouzy passion.—
Book 11. chap. xv. p. 315, col. 2.

In Marston thus :—

Herod. Upon four great madonnas have 1 this asternoon grafted

the forked tree ἔ

Hercules. Is’t possible?

Herod. Possible? Fie on this satiety ?—'tis a dull, blunt, wear-y,
and drowsy passion.—“The Fawn‚'’ IV. i. 103-8.

Marston’s phrase “grafted the forked tree” is also
from Montaigne :—

He would hardly have perswaded Calisthenes to refuse his faire
daughter Agarista to Hippoclides, because he had seen him graft the
forked tree in her upon a table.—-Book ΙΙ. chap. xii. p. 299, col. z.

The parallel in Webster comes in with other
matter that was manifestly filched from Montaigne,

montaigne,
W ebster,
and
Marston :
