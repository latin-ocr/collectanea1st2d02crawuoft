It occurs several times in Thomas Nashe and in
Gabriel Harvey, as well as in Sir Philip Sidney and
in The Epistle ofMartin Marprelate, 1588.

Ι turn now to the forms ofsalutation that are noted
by Bacon. There are several of these, but I will
notice only the following, viz., “good-morrow,’'
“ good-day,” “good-night‚” and “good-even.” The
reason for this selection will appear presently. Be-
cause Bacon notes these forms of salutation the
Baconians imagine that he coined them3 and Mrs.
Pott draws us a harrowing picture to show how
boorish our ancestors were in their manner of greet-
ing each other. They could only exclaim, with
more or less grace, “How now!'’ or make use of
some such uncouth expression. But Bacon came
into the world to put things right3 he saw that every-
thing was out of joint ; and he not only invented the
better part of the English language, but, to show the
love and care he had for his benighted countrymen,
he taught them to say “good-day,’' “good-morrow.''
Mrs. Pott ought to know, for she has searched 328
known authors and upwards of 5300 of their works
There cannot, therefore, be any doubt about the
matter. Here are her words:—

“It is certain that the habit of using forms of morning and eve-
ning salutation was not introduced into England prior to the date 01
Bacon’s notes, 1594.’‘
