“Rede me and be nott Wrothe,'‘ ἀς.) ΑΛ). 1528.

Another phrase of Bacon’s invention is “out of
tune,’' which occurs in Hamlet‚ III. i. 167 :—
Like sweet bells jangled‚ out of tune and harsh.

Dr. Theobald seems to have dropped on this dis-
covery quite accidentally whilst reading the Novum
Organum. All great discoveries corne by accident,
and, when found, people wonder that they remained
so long hidden. Nobody ever used such phrases be-
fore Bacon invented them, nor did any author ever
employ any of the 230 words noted by Dr. Theo-
as of Bacon’s coinage. There are only about thirty
of them to be found in Rede me and be nott W rothe,
which was written some time after the Flood, and
the same little book is so much out of joint that it
actually has “out of tune” also 1—-

Yet are they so farre out of tune.

The “they” in this line seems to be an interpola—

tion, indicating Bacon's own opinion of the authors
of the book.

Under Promus No. 708 Bacon refers to the saying
that men who have great responsibilities are like por-
ters who carry a load on each shoulder‚ and another
on the top of their head. The note is alluded to in
