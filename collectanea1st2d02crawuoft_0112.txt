pressed Shakespeare are the very ones from which he
will borrow or to which he will allude; and it some-
times happens that such works will not have been
issued from the press many months or even weeks
before the registration or acting of some of his poems
or plays. Here we have a case in point. Let us
look at some dates. Troilus and Cressida was com-
posed in or about 1603, Julius Caesar in or about
16003 both plays were most certainly written after
April, 1599, the date of the registration of Sir John
Davies’ Nosce Teipsum. Now it was not from Plato
at all that Shakespeare obtained his idea and the
phraseology in which he clothed it, but from the
poem of Sir J0hn Davies, who expounds it at great
length. The passages necessary to establish the fact
that Shakespeare borrowed from Sir John Davies
would take up too much room, and it is not neces-
sary to my argument to prove the borrowing in this
case. The suggestion is that the Platonic idea must
have been derived from the original Greek, and that
Shakespeare's ignorance of the latter precluded him
from consultin g Plato‚whose work was not then trans-
lated. Consequently, say the Baconians‚ Shakespeare
did not write Troilus and Cressida and Julius Caesar.
