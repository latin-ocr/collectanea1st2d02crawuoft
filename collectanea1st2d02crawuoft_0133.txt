Cranfield’s saying. Hence we have Ben Jonson,
Shakespeare‚ Marlowe, and Bacon together3 for has
not Dr. Theobald, who knows Marlowe's work so
well, told us that it was written by Bacon?

Sir Lionel Cranfield's saying was much liked by
Ben Jonson, who could not help using it twice in
this play, and elsewhere. Take another case of its
use, which occurs in the Induction to Cynthia's
Revels:—

znd Child. A fifth only shakes his bottle head, and out of his corky
brain squeezeth out a pitiful learned face and is silent.

By way of contrast‚ I will now take one of Dr.
Theobald's parallels and show what it is worth. It
is one of those posers that are so difficult to answer,
and great store is set by it.

In the De Augmentis, Book IV. chap. 1.‚ Bacon
mentions the case of Anaxarchus, “who, when put
to the torture, bit off his tongue and spit it in the
tyrant's face.'' The passage is compared with Shake-

Spefll'e :—

Boling. Ere my tongue
Shall wound mine honour with such feeble wrong,
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
The slavish motive of recanting sear,
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray‘s face.
“Richard 11.” Ι. i. 190-5.

Dr. Theobald traces the story to Diogenes Laer-
