they are expressed in language and illustrated by
{mages drawn from Bacon's own work. Neverthe-
less, although he professes in these notes to refer to
Bacon’s writings and speeches‚ he does not copy or
quote Bacon more closely in them than he does in
many of his other Discoveries.

Here is a quotation from the Acldress to the Reader
prefixed to The Alchemist. It is made up of parts of
two Discoveries, bits of which are transposed to accord
with the structure of the address, and every word
of it, save the linking phrases, copies the notes ver-
batim. Not only so, the notes and the address repeat
Bacon :—

For they commend writers, as they do fencers or wrestlers; who
if they come in robustuous1y‚ and put for it with a great deal of
violence, are received for the bravcvr fellows: when many times their
own rudeness is the cause of their disgrace, and a little touch of their
adversary gives all that boisterous force the soil. Ι deny not, but that
these men, who always seek to do more than enough, may sometime
happen on something that is good, and great3 but very seldom : and
when it comes it doth not recompense the rest of their ill. It sticks
out, perhap5, and is more eminent, because all is sordid and vile about
it, as lights are more discerned in a thick darkness, than a faint
shadow. I speak not this, out of hope to do good to any man against
his will 3 for 1 know, if Ι were put to the question of theirs and mine,
the worse would find more suffrages: because the most favour com-
mon errors. But 1 give this warning, that there is a great difference
between those, that, to gain the opinion of copy, utter all they can,
however unfitly3 and those that use election and a mean. For it is
only the disease of the unskilful, to think rude things greater than
polished ς οι· scattered more numerous than composed.
