in hac urbe irfinitum ,· quacunque enim ingredimur, in aliquam historiam montaigne'
vestigium ponimus [Cicero‚ “ S. de Fin.'']. So great a power of ad- IVebster
monition is in the very place. And that in this city is most infinite, '
for which way soever we walke‚ we set our foote upon some history, and

. even her ruine is glorious with renow ne, and swolne with fflslarnon ‚-
glorie. —Book 111. chap. lx. p. 511, col. 2. &c

Cariola. Or rather like some reverend monument

Whose ruins are even pitied.
“The Duchess of Malfi‚'‘ IV. ii. 40-1‚ p. 86, col. 1.

Marston, too, lingered over the allusion to Rome,
and hence these magnificent lines :—

Erictho. Know then, our love, hard by the reverent ruins
Of a once glorious temple rear‘d to Jove,
Whose very rubbish (like the pitied fall
Of virtue most unfortunate) yet bears
A deathless majesty, though now quite razed, &a
“Sophonisba,” IV. i. 144-8.

The parallels in Montaigne and Marston are so
numerous and so close that I find it will save time
and labour to students ifI record them as they occur
in Marston’s work. Only close or interesting coinci-
dences in the two authors will be noticed, and those
that have already been dealt with will, of course, be
excluded from the list, which is far from being com-
plete.

Several of Montaigne’s quotations from Latin and
other authors are used by Marston and Webster :—

Malheureux. 0 miseri quorum gaudia crimen haluwin—“The Dutch
courtezan‚” 11. i. 82.
