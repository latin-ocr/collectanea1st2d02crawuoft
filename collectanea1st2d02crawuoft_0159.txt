But Dr. Theobald has omitted to include in his
examples one use of the word “sweet,” which has
a peculiarly perverse sense, and which is explained
many times over in the pages of Ben jonson.

Bacon’s inquiries into the question of odours are
most interesting. In The Natural History he refers
to the ancient observation that where a rainbow seems
to hang over or to touch the earth, thence arise sweet
persumes, which are more fragrant and pleasing than
those odours which arisc when the earth is wetted
with soft showers of rain. The cause of the odours,
he explains, is not in the rainbow or in the shower,
but in the earth itself‚ which contains certain matter
req uirin g only moisture from the atmosphere to make
it break forth into sweetness.

The above enables us to comprehend the extra-
ordinary figure of speech employed by Almanac in
The Staple ofNews, IV. i., where he declares that
Pecunia's breath is “as sweet as meadows after rain.’'

In some way or other Bacon's inquiries seem to
be related to the following entry in the Promm, No.

A sweete dampe (a dislike of moist persume).
