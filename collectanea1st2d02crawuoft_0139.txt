Ingrato voces prostituisse foro.

These lines, word for word, form Pramus No. 440.
Bacon could not have used thern more neatly than
Jonson does.

Again, in the first scene of Act I. Ovid recites his
Elegia XV. Book Ι. Now there is a curious history
attaching to the translation of this elegy. In Mar-
lowe’s work there are two versions of it, one only
slightly differing from the other. Of the three edi-
tions of these elegies collated by Dyce the one lettered
“A,” which from internal evidence appears to be the
oldest, does not include the one headed “The same
by B. J.” which Jonson uses in The Poetaster. One
translation is merely an improved version of the other,
and both must have come from the same pen. Ergo,
the rough sketch attributed to Marlowe is Bacon’s
first attempt to translate Ovid 3 and the more finished
one is the one that he paraded under the name of
Ben Jonson, who became Bacon’s tool after the death
of Marlowe. Nothing could be clearer, the proof is
plain, and Dr. Theobald is vindicated.

With regard to Virgil, Jonson makes Tibullus give
