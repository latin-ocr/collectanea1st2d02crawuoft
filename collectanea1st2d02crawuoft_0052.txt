but I will not stay to point out the resemblances3 yet
it is interesting to note that a correction by Dyce
accords with the phrasing in the Essays :—

Flamim’o. What is ’t you doubt? her coyness? that 's but the super-
ficies of lust most women have : yet why should ladies blush to hear
that named which they do not sear to handle? 0, they are politic :
they know our desire is increased by the difficulty of enjoying 3 whereas
satiety is a blunt, weary and drowsy passion.—“The White Devil‚‘’
ll. 103-9‚ p. 6, col. 2.

The old quartos make Flamineo say “where a
satiety is‚'' &a Dyce altered to “whereas,'’ the
word used by Montaigne.

The last words of Herod's speech are followed by
this question :—

Who would be a proper fellow to be thus greedily devoured and
swallowed among ladies? Faith, ’tis a torment—my very rack!

Hercules. Right, Herod, true3 for imagine all a man possess’d with
a perpetual pleasure, like that of generation, even in the highest lus-
ciousness, he straight sinks as unable to bear so continual, so pure,
so universal a sensuality.-—Ll. 108-16.

Almost literally from Montaigne, as is much other
matter in the same scene :—

When 1 imagine man fraught with all the commodities may be
wished, let us suppose all his severall members were for ever possessed
with a pleasure like unto that of generatim, even in the highest point
that may be3 1 finde him to sinke under the burden of his ease,
and perceive him altogether unable to beare so pure, so constant, and
so universall a sensuality.-—Book 11. chap. xx. pp. 344-5.
