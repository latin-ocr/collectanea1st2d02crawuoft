with a vengeance! Shakespeare never parallels Baeon
properly, but Jonson does :—

Such knowledge as is digged out of the hard mine of history and
experience.—“ Filium Labyrinthi.''
A true pioner in that mine of truth which (he said) lay so deep.—

Letter to Burghley, 1592.

In his Underwoods, in the poem on Sir John Bean-
mont‚ Jonson speaks of“creeping common pioners''
that “sweat to fortify a Muse’'; and in No. 31 of
the same collection of verses he has :—

He can approve
And estimate thy pains, as having wrought
In the same mines of knowledge.

The saying is also alluded to by Lady Haughty
in The Silent Woman, Act IV. sc. ii.
Pramus, No. 60, is a verse frorn Horace, Epistle
II. i. 14 :--
Extinctus amabitur idem,
and this entry is closely related to No. 69, of uncer-
tain authorship :—-

Nemo virtuti invidiam reconciliaverit praeter mortem.
Indeed, the relationship between the two entries is
established by Horace himself, in the same Epistle,
ll. 10-2‚ where he says that “he who crushed the
direful hydra, and subdued well-known monsters
with fated labour, found envy to be conquered only
at his latter end.''
