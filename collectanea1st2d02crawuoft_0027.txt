Women are more willingly and more gloriously chaste, when they are
least restrained of their liberty.-—“The White Devil,” 11. 192-4‚ p. 8,
col. 1.

But Montaigne, who is arguing that a man should
marry a rich woman rather than a poor one, declares

that such a wife will be—

More willingly and glorious.'y chaste, by how much fairer they are.—
Book 11. chap. viii. p. 198, col. 2.

Women are like curst dogs: civility keeps them tied all day-time,
but they are let loose at mid-night3 then they do most good, or most
mischief.—“The White Devil‚” 11. 320-3‚ p. 9, col. z.

Note the word “civility''; it is the reading of the
1612 quart03 the quartos of 1631, 1665, and 1672
read “cruelty,'’ This latter reading is borne out by
Montaigne :—

Beleeve it, they [women] will have fire: Luxuria ipsis vinculis,
sicutfira bestia, irritata deinde emissa: “Luxurie is like a wild beast‚
first made fiercer with tying‚ and then let loose. They must have
the reynes given thern a little.‘’—Book ΙΙΙ. chap. v. p. 450, col. 1.

It is cruelty, not eivilsty, that keeps the beast tied up3
and the object of this incivility is to make it more
vicious when let loose. Montaigne argues for more
freedom, not restraint.

MontaIgne has a tilt at a certain class of scholars
who delight in disputations and hair-splitting3 and
he selects for particular censure a Master of Arts.
Deprive him, he says, of his gown, his Latin, and
his Aristotle, and he will appear but a very ordinary
