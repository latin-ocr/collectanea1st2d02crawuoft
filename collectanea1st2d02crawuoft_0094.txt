the Baconians appear to have missed it; and let the
reader say if this man, who employed it so frequently,
could, if he wrote Shakespeare’s plays, avoid using it
at least once or twice in them, or even very many
times.

1. “Fair and moderate courses are ever best in causes of estate3
the rather, because 1 wish,'' &c.-“To the Duke of Buckingham,’'
March 7, 1620.

2. “Yet 1 am unwilling to put my sickle in another's harvest,
but to leave it to the lawyers of the Scottish nation 3 the rather, be-
cause Ι imagine‚'' &c.—“ The Union of the Laws?

3. “Which maketh me presume, with good assurance, that your
lordship will accept well of these my labours, the rather, because your
lordship in private hath often,’' &c.—“To the Lord Chancellor‚ on
sending him his book of ‘The Advancement of Leaming? ’¹

4. “ . . . which (Ι assure yourself) I desire the rather, because,
being placed‚'‘ &c.-“To the Lord Chancellor, Montague, vol. iii. p. 3 ς.

that the form of expression is a common one in
Bacon3 nevertheless, it is not of Bacon’s invention ;
for it was used by others quite as early as Bacon
wrote, and, like the word “real,’' by men who had
a university education. Ben Jonson also uses it :—

1. Tub. The rather may you judge it to be such

Because the bridegroom was described, &c-
“A Tale of a Tub‚'‘ 111. i.

z. Cic. It shall be dearer rather, and because

1 'd make it such, hear how much, &a
“Cataline‚” III. ii.
