But ours of others will not be acknowne.
“Cornelia‚’' Act 11. i. 229, Boas.

Moreover, in this case, as in many others, a little
trouble would have saved Dr. Theobald from making
an egregious blunder. There are hills beyond Pent-
land. Acknown is the past participle of acknowe, O.E.
oncnawan, to recognize.

&annena—In Hamlet, IV. v. 178, Shakespeare
uses the word “in its classic and etymologica] sense,
from Latin doceo, teach ; give a lesson or instruction ;
documentum=a Iesson, or example, &c.”

A document iu madness.

Dr. Theobald quotes cases of the use of the word
from Spenser and Sir Walter Raleigh‚ both of whom
wrote much earlier than Shakespeare did in Hamlet.
Some say that Bacon also wrote Spenser's work3 and
perhaps Dr. Theobald wishes us to infer that he wrote
Raleigh’s H istory of the W orld as well. Ralcigh had
many contributors, and Bacon may have been among
the number. However, document, as used in Humlet,
is respectable old English, and it occurs in a curious
old play with the funny title The longer thou livea,
the morefool thou art, circa 1553-8 :—

Conscience accuseth the folish beast,
That he hath forsaken wholsom document.
Ll. 961-2 (“Jahrbuch,’' vol. xxxvi. p. 40).
