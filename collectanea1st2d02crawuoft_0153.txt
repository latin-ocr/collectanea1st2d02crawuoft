see that his claim for Bacon is refuted by Bacon in
the very passage that he quotes :—

Some build rather upon the abusing of others, and (as wc now
say) putting tricks upon them, &c.—Essay of “Cunning.”

Dr. Theobald might have added that this phrase is
met with again in the Spurious Apophthegms‚ No. 1 6 :—

Two scholars and a countryman, travelling upon the road, one
night lodged all in one inn and supped together, where the scholars
thought to have put a trick upon the countryman, διε.

However, the phrase is to be found in Ben Jonson
several times. It occurs in Every Man in his Humoum
twice in Catiline3 in The New Inn3 and again in
Bartholomew Fair. Yet Dr. Theobald is so confident
of the Baconian origin of the phrase, and of the time
at which it was minted‚ that he adduces it as a piece
of evidence in regard to the dates of two of Shake-
speare’s plays which use it :—

As neither of these plays [The Tempest and All ’s Wcll] were [sic]
known till 1623, there is no reason for giving the phrase an earlier

date than the Essay [1612].

Now Jonson uses the expression in both versions
of his Every Man in his Humour‚ and therefore it
was current as early as 1596.

to a Baconian, he removes his hat and bows his body.
It is such a “profound philosophical expression ’';
