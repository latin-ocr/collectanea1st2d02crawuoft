Montaigne for a saying in the following speech :—

Hcrcules. Your father, I may boldly say, he‘s an ass
To hope that you’ll forbear to swallow

What he cannot chew3 &c.
“The Fawn,'’ 111. i. 512-14.

But there can be no manner of doubt about the origin
of the same or a similar saying in Webster‚ who, like
Montaigne, uses it in relation to the question of self-
slaughter. Montaigne notes instances of men who
have attempted, but failed, to kill themselves outright,
courage having deserted them in their extremity.
The smarting wounds they inflicted upon themselves
served but to intensify the anguish of mind they
already suffered, thus adding to their torments. To
kill oneself with a sword requires a steady hand and
an unsaltering purpose3 at the moment of execution
there is no time to consult flesh and blood3 the mor-
tal instrument

is a meate a man must swallow without chewing, &c.—Book 11.
chap. xiii. p. 312, col. z.
Vit. Cor. To kill one's self is meat that we must take
Like pills, not chew ’t, but quickly swallow it;
The smart o’ the wound, or weakness of the hand,

May else bring treble torments.
“The White Devil,” ll. 3319-22‚ p. 47, col. 2.

The previous speech by Vittoria Corombona elicits
a reply from Flamineo which also is a close imitation
of Montaigne :—
