NJmphadoro. Thou art private with the duke3 thou belongest to
his close-stool.-—“The Fawn‚ 1. ii. 46-7.

The most common and soundest part of men holdeth multitude
of children to be a signe of great happinesse and comfort; So do Ι,
and many others, the w'ant of them.-Book Ι. chap. xl. p. 1 23, col. 2.

Hercules. Oh! ‘tis a blessed assurance of Heaven’s favour, and
long-lasting name, to have many children.

Amoroso. But I ha' none, Fawn‚ now.

Hercules. O that’s most excellent—a right special happiness.—
“The Fawn‚’' ΙΙ. ἰ. 132—7.

A misprint, which even Mr. Bullen has not at-
tempted to correct, occurs in the following passage,
where “brued” should read either “bound” or
“glued‚” the former word being probably the correct
one. The phrasing in Marston is palpably an imita-
tion of Florio, as the following will show :—

Hercules. There's some weakness in your brother you wrinkle at
thus3 come, prithee, impart; what? we are mutually incorporated,

turn’d one into another, brued [sic] together.—“The Fawn‚'’ II. i.

176-9.

In the amitie 1 speake, they entermixe and counfound themselves
one in the other, with so universali a commixtum, that they weare
out and can no more finde the seame that hath conjoined them to-
gether . . . And at our first meefing, which was by chance at a great
feast, and solemne meeting of a whole towneship‚ we found our selves
so surprized, so knowne, so acquainted‚ and so combinedly bound to-
gether, that from thence forward, nothing was so neer unto us as one
unto anothers.—Book I. chap. xxvii. pp. 85-6.

That is to say, let the rest be our oxvne3 yet not so combined and
glued together that it may not be sundred without fleaing uS, διε.-
