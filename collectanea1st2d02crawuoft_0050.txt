Marston had taken notes from Montaigne, Book
I. chap. xl. pp. 1 17-18. Another case of borrow-
ing from the same interesting chapter occurs in The
thite Devil‚ where Flamineo is caught in the toils‚
and about to meet death. He laughs at the threats
of Lodovico, and follows up this display of merriment
in the presence of death by asking 2-—

would’st have me die, as Ι was born, in whining?

Gasparo. Recommend yourself to heaven.
Flam. N0‚ I will carry mine own commendations thither.

Lines 3461-3‚ p. 49, col. 2.

To another that exhorted him to recommend himselfe to God, he
asked‚ “Who is going to him ?” And the fellow answering, “Your-
selfe shortly :’' “If it be his good pleasure‚ I would to God it might
be to mori-ow night,'’ replied he. “Recommend but your selfe to
him,'’ said the other, “and you shail quickly be there.'' “It is best
then,” answered he, “that my selfe carry mine own commendations

to him.” P. 118, col. 1.
Again, Montaigne states that William, Duke of

Guienne,
for penance-sake, wore continually a corselet under a religious habit.—

P. 122, col. 2.

In The White Devil “two noblemen of Hungary ”
who accompany “ the Moor‚” are said to

have vowed for ever to wear, next their bare bodies, those coats of

mail they served in.

Hortensio. Hard penance ἔ
Lines 2366-9, p. 35, col. 2.

Webster was surely thinking of Montaigne.
