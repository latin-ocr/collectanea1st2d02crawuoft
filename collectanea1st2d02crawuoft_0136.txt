Ease and relaxation are profitable to all studies. The mind is like
the bow, the stronger by being unbent.—“Disc0veries: Otium‚'' &c.

In the essay of Trutlz Bacon quotes the saying of
Montaigne :—

If it be well weighed, to say that a man lieth, is as much as to
say, that he is brave towards God, and a coward towards men. For
a lie faces God, and shrinks from man.

Compare :—

Fastidious. A kind of affectionate reverence strikes me with a cold
shivering, methinks.

Macilente. 1 like such tempers well, as stand before their mistresses
with fear and trembling3 and before their Maker, like impudent
mountains.—“Every Man out of his Humour,’' Act ΙΙΙ. sc. iii.

Aristotle's doctrine of antiperistasis occupies a large
space in the philosophy of Bacon, who applies it to
individuals and states as well as to nature :—

The force of an agent is augmented by the antiperistasis of the
counteracting body, is a rule in civil states as in nature, for all faction

is vehemently moved and incensed at the rising ofa contrary faction.
-—“De Aug.‚” Book III. chap. 1.

And he makes this note in the Promus :—

In circuitu ambulant impii-honest by antiperistasis.

Many passages from his work could be quoted to
show that Bacon’s notion of antiperistasis is quite
different from the notion that can be extracted from
the following, which Mrs. Pott, perhaps jokingly,

cites from Shakespeare :—-

I'll devise some honest slanders.—“Much Ado‚’' 111. i. 84.
Its . . fery honest knaveries.—-“Merry Wives‚’' IV. iv. 82-3.
