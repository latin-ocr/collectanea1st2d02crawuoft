Crisp. Virtuous marriage Ξ there is no more affinity betwixt virtue
and marriage than betwixt a man and his horse3 &c.-—“The Dutch
Courtezan‚” 111. i. 88-90.

Those who thinke to honour marriage byjoyning love unto it (in
mine opinion) doe as those who, to doe vertue a favour, holde that
nobilitie is no other thing than vertue. Indeed, these things have
affinitie, but therewithall great difference3 their names and titles
should not thus be commixt3 both are wronged so to be confounded.—-
Book 111. chap. v· p. 432, col. 1.

See also The Fawn, III. i. 212, where Marston
says that “love or virtue are not of the essence of
marriage.’'
