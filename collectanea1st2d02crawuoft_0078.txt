But must we say she 's dead? may ’t not be said,
That as a sunder’d clock is piecemeal laid,
Not to be lost, but by the maker’s hand
Repolish'd, without error then to stand . . .
May 't not be said, that her grave shall restore
Her, greater, purer, firmer than before?
“Anatomy‚ A F uneral Elegy,” 11. 37-46.

Webster has copied these lines in his Elegy as well
as in The Duchess ochzlfi3 and Donne’s “must we

say she 's dead ?” finds an answer in the reference to

Prince Henry, l. 3, “we cannot say he ’s dead.’'
Thus in the play :—
Antonio. Best of my life, farewell, since we must part :
Heaven hath a hand in ἐς but no otherwise
Than as some curious artist takes in sunder

A clock and watch‚ when it is out of frame,
To bring ’t in better orden—III. v. 75-9, p. 83, col. 1.

And in the Elegy thus :--

Or like a dial, broke in wheel or screw,

That’s ta’en in pieces to be made go true:

So to eternity he now shall stand,

New—form'd and gloried by the all—working hand.

Ll. 241-4·
After the Donne lines in the play, just quoted,

there follow passages stolen from Sir Philip Sidney,
Sir Francis Bacon, and, very possibly, Ben Jonson3

and then we shake hands with Donne again :—

Ant. Heaven fashion’d us of nothing3 and we strive
To bring ourselves to nothing.—Ll. 98—9.
