A young man demanded of the philosopher Panetius, whether it
would beseeme a wise man to be in lovc3 let wisc men alone (quoth
he), δια-3001( 111. chap. v. p. 454, col. Ι.

Malheureux. May it beseem a wise man to be in love?
Freevill. Let wise men alone, 'twill beseem thee and me well
enough.-—“Thc Dutch Courtezan,’' II. i. 98-100.

Hee that could dine with the smoke of roste meat, might he not
dine at a cheape rate? would he not soon bee rich ?—Book 111.
chap. v. p. 448, col. 2.

Free. O friend, he that could live with the smoke of ronst-meat
might live at a cheap rate !-“The Dutch Courtezan,'’ 11. i. 1 10-1 1.

I will vary matters now by a few quotations from
Webster.

Montaigne says of marriage :—

It may be compared to a cage, the birds without dispaire to get
in, and those within dispaire to get out.——Book 111. chap. v. p. 433,
col. 1.

Webster applies the figure to cases of illicit love z·—

Flumineo. . . . 'tis just like a summer bird-cage iu a garden3
the birds that are without despair to get in, and the birds that are
within despair, and are in a consumption, for fear they shall never get
out.—“The White Devil, ll. 131-5, p. 7, col. 1.

Man's senses often deceive him, and cause him to
receive impressions which he knows to be false.
Amongst other instances Montaigne cites the case
of the eyes :—

When we winke a little with our eye, wee perceive the bodies we
looke upon to seeme longer and outstretched.
